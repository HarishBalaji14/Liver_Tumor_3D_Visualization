3D Tumor Visualization

Project Overview

This project aims to create a 3D visualization tool for analyzing the growth of cancer in the liver using MRI images. The tool takes MRI scans as input, processes the images to segment the tumor, and visualizes the 3D growth of the tumor over time.

Features

Reads MRI images in various formats (e.g. DICOM, NIfTI)
Segments the tumor from the surrounding liver tissue using advanced image processing techniques
Visualizes the 3D tumor growth using a interactive 3D rendering engine
Allows for exploration of the tumor's shape, size, and growth patterns over time
Supports multiple MRI scan series for longitudinal analysis
Technical Details

Built using [list programming languages and libraries used, e.g. Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, VTK]
Utilizes [list specific algorithms or techniques used, e.g. thresholding, region growing, level sets]
Compatible with [list operating systems and hardware requirements]
Example Use Cases

Researchers can use this tool to analyze the effectiveness of different cancer treatments on tumor growth
Clinicians can use this tool to track the progression of cancer in patients over time and make informed treatment decisions
Medical students can use this tool to gain a better understanding of cancer growth patterns and anatomy
